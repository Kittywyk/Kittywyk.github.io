I volunteered at the [International Geoinformatics Summer School (IGSS)](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/en2024/05/2024-igss-welcomes-you-to-join-us/) and traveled with the participants to the Sponge Park in Qingshan District, Wuhan for a field study and served as an English interpreter during this trip.
