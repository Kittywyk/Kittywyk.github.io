## About Me

I'm currently working toward the master's degree with the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing (LIESMARS), Wuhan University, China. My current research interests include urban perception and computer vision. Previously I mainly worked in the area of low-level vision and domain adaptation-based object detection.
