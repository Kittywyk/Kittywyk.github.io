## About Me
I'm a master's student currently affiliated with the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing (LIESMARS), Wuhan University, China. I am supervised by [Prof. Zhenfeng Shao](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/prof_web/shaozhenfeng/index.html).

I have research experience in unsupervised domain adaptation for object detection and low-level vision. My current research interest is AI for Earth Observation.
